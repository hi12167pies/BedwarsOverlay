- Press the backtick (`` ` ``) key to toggle the visibility of the overlay
- This does not work in fullscreen!

(This is not copied from Abyss Overlay what are you talking about?)
- You can use the command `/w ![username]` in game to check a person's stats

Your api key is invalid or you have reached a rate limit. Try resetting your key.
