# Stats overlay for bedwars.

### This is just a side project, do not expect updates or for it to be good :)

Usage:
1. Set the path to your logs in `src/js/stats.js`
2. Launch you will be prompted for api key. If you wish to change the api key latter use the `, (comma)` key while having the overlay focused.
3. In game use the `/who` command to list players. This will see your logs and update the gui.
